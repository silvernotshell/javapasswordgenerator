# Password Generator Starter Code
Description: A password generator created in JavaScript which randomly produces secure passwords that adhere to the criteria set by the user. 

User Story: As an employee with access to sensitive data, I want to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria so that I can create a strong password that provides greater security. 

Acceptance Criteria: Given I need a new, secure password... 

When I click the button to generate a password, then I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria

When prompted for password criteria, then I select which criteria to include in the password

When prompted for the length of the password, then I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters

When asked for character types to include in the password, then I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters

When I answer each prompt, then my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected

When all prompts are answered, then a password is generated that matches the selected criteria

When the password is generated, then the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
